Django CTF App
What is a CTF?

Capture the Flag (CTF) is a gamified cybersecurity event where participants (individuals or teams) compete by solving challenges that involve finding hidden information ("flags") within simulated or controlled environments. CTFs provide a fun and engaging way to learn and test one's skills in various areas of cybersecurity, including cryptography, steganography, web security, forensics, and more.

About This App

This Django application provides a framework for creating and conducting your own CTF competitions.

Key Features:

Challenge Creation: Easily design various CTF challenges catering to different difficulty levels, including cryptography, steganography, web security, forensics, and more.
User Management: Manage participants and teams, allowing registration, authentication, and progress tracking.
Flag Management: Implement flags with different formats (text, images, files) and hide them within challenges for participants to discover.
Leaderboard: Track team or individual progress through a dynamic leaderboard, fostering healthy competition.
Submission System: Provide a secure and efficient mechanism for participants to submit their captured flags.
